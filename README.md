This Rust program uses Euler's Criterion to determine whether a given number, a, is a quadratic residue modulo a prime number, p. 
A quadratic residue modulo p is a number a for which there exists an integer x such that x^2 ≡ a (mod p).

The program  includes 
1 The Euler's Criterion, which determines if a number is a quadratic residue modulo a prime number (p).
2. Modular Exponentiation which effectively computes big powers modulo p.
3. GCD Calculation which uses the greatest common divisor to determine whether two numbers are coprime.
